You'll need to set up a backend server to handle form submissions, process data, and send emails or perform other actions as needed. Ensure that the server-side code is secure to prevent potential security vulnerabilities. On the frontend, you can link the form submission to your backend endpoints using JavaScript. Keep in mind that specific steps may vary based on your backend technology and preferences."

Use the existing components as a reference to maintain consistency with the template's design and functionality. Next, within the <i>public/data/sections.json</i> file, create an item for the new section, where you can define all the necessary data such as texts, links, and other information. After completing these steps, your new section should be fully integrated into the theme."
